c 
c     SECOND VERSION OF THE 'edf' PROGRAM. 
c
c     The following tasks are carried out:
c
c     1) Read the wavefunction and the atomic overlap matrix (AOM) 
c     2) Compute the electron number distribution function (EDF)
c        using the fragments defined in the input file.
c     3) Localize the input natural orbitals using the Cioslowski 
c        isopycnic localization method.
c     4) Compute the EDF from the wave function expanded in terms
c        of the isopycnic MOs. If all works properly, it should be 
c        exactly the same than that obtained in 2)
c     5) Compute an approximate EDF assuming that all the localized 
c        orbitals are orthogonal within all the defined fragments. This 
c        is exact when there are only two fragments and the localized 
c        orbitals are those resulting from the diagonalization of the 
c        overlap matrix (within one of the two fragments) between the 
c        molecular orbitals corresponding to a single-determinant wave 
c        function.
c
c        Tasks 3,4, and 5 are optional.
c
c.....EDF reads the aimpac .WFN file written by the GAMESS or GAUSSIAN 
c     packages, reads (or computes) the overlap integrals between the 
c     molecular orbitals (MOs) within all the basins, and obtains the 
c     probabilities of having exactly an integer number of electrons
c     n_1 in fragment 1, n_2 electrons in  fragment 2, ..., and n_m 
c     electrons in fragment 'm' of the molecule. The sum of the 'm' 
c     fragments must be necessarily equal to the whole molecule, and 
c     each atom can only be ascribed to a single fragment.
c
c.....Three categories of basins can be used in EDF:
c
c     1) The atomic basins of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules
c        (QTAIM) or atomic QTAIM basins.
c     2) The basins of the Electron Localization Function (ELF) or
c        ELF basins.
c     3) The basins (computed within the program itself) corresponding
c        to a partition of the molecule into fuzzy atomic basins. There
c        are three of such fuzzy atomic partitions included in the EDF 
c        code which are based on Mulliken, Lowdin, and MinDef atoms, 
c        respectively. Mulliken and Lowdin atoms are well-known and do
c        not deserve further comments. 'MinDef' atoms correspond to the
c        Minimally Deformed Atoms in Molecules defined by J. Fernandez 
c        rico et. al.. See for instance, 
c
c           a) "Analysis of the molecular density" 
c               Fernández Rico, J.; López, R.; Ramírez, G. 
c               J Chem Phys  1999, 110, 4213-4220.
c
c           b) "Analysis of the molecular density: STO densities2
c               Fernández Rico, J.; López, R.; Ema, I.; Ramírez, G.  
c               J Chem Phys 2002, 117, 533-540. 
c
c.....The overlap integrals within the atomic QTAIM basins are read in
c     by EDF with three different formats, corresponding to three 
c     different computational codes: PROMOLDEN, PROAIM, and TOPMOD.
c
c.....The overlap integrals within the ELF basins are read in exclusi-
c     vely with the format of TOPMOD code.
c
c
c.....Input (standard unit).............................................
c     (CAPITAL lettters are fixed names in the input)
c
c=====Record 1: ioverlap
c
c     ioverlap = 0  ==> The file with the overlaps between MOs comes from
c                       the PROMOLDEN program, or 'filedat' in the next 
c                       record is 'mulliken', 'lowdin','mindef', 'mindefrho',
c                       'netrho', 'promrho', 'heselmann', or 'becke'.
c     ioverlap = 1  ==> The file with the overlaps between MOs comes from 
c                       the PROAIM program.
c     ioverlap = 2  ==> The file with the overlaps between MOs comes from
c                       the TOPMOD program with ELF basins.
c     ioverlap = 3  ==> The file with the overlaps between MOs comes from
c                       the TOPMOD program with QTAIM basins.
c     ioverlap = 4  ==> The file with the overlaps between MOs comes from
c                       the AIMALL program with QTAIM basins.
c     ioverlap = -1 ==> Complex Atomic Overlap Matrix (See 'edfx.f' file
c                       for information about the input in this case)
c
c=====Record 2: filedat  
c
c        Name of the file containing the atomic overlap matrix (AOM) 
c        between canonical MOs.
c
c        Instead of an existing 'filedat' file, the following keywords
c        are also valid in record 2.
c
c        filedat = 'mulliken' ---> The AOM is computed using a space 
c                   partitioning according to the Mulliken population 
c                   analysis method.
c        
c
c        filedat = 'lowdin' ---> The AOM is computed using a space 
c                   partitioning according to the Lowdin population 
c                   analysis method.
c
c        filedat = 'mindef' ---> The AOM is computed using a space 
c                   partitioning according to the minimally deformed 
c                   (mindef) atoms defined by Fernadez Rico et at.
c
c        filedat = 'mindefrho' ---> Same as above but with weights
c                   'w_A=rho_A/rho', that always give S_ii^A > 0 values.
c
c                   In this case, three integers can be given after 
c                   the MINDEFRHO keyword: NANG, NRAD and IRMESH,
c                   that represent the number of angular (NANG) and 
c                   radial (NRAD)  points in the integration, and the
c                   radial mapping (IRMESH).
c
c        filedat = 'netrho' ---> Same as above but with weights
c                   'w_A=rho_A/rho' determined with the so-called net
c                   densities, which elliminate all mixed (i.e. primitives
c                   in two different centers) densities when the w_A are
c                   computed.
c
c                   In this case, three integers can be given after 
c                   the MINDEFRHO keyword: NANG, NRAD and IRMESH,
c                   that represent the number of angular (NANG) and 
c                   radial (NRAD)  points in the integration, and the
c                   radial mapping (IRMESH).
c
c        filedat = 'promrho' ---> Same as above with 'w_A=rho_A/rho',
c                   being each 'rho_A' the IN VACUO atomic density 
c                   of the atom computed with the seven term analytical
c                   expression derived by fitting the Koga STO 
c                   atomic densities with the AUXPI code.
c
c        filedat = 'heselmann' ---> Identifies that the weights used
c                  in a chemical localization are those defined by
c                  Andreas Heselmann, JCTC 12, 2720-2741 (2016).
c
c        filedat = 'becke' ---> The AOM is computed using Becke's recipe
c
c                   In this case, four integers can be given
c                   after the MINDEFRHO keyword: NANG, NRAD, IRMESH, and 
c                   POW, that represent the number of angular (NANG) and 
c                   radial (NRAD)  points in the integration, the radial 
c                   mapping (IRMESH), and the iterative K parameter of
c                   Becke's method (POW).
c
c
c        In these five cases, ioverlap = 0 in Record 1 is required.
c
c=====Record 3: wfnfile
c
c        Name of the .WFN file containing the definition of the wave
c        function. In the case of a CASSCF calculation this includes 
c        the determinant coefficients and the occupation numbers of 
c        their molecular spin-orbitals. Files of this type are presently
c        available for .WFN files coming from a domestic version of the 
c        GAMESS10 code. It is clear that the overlap integrals read 
c        in from 'filedat' must correspond to the wave function given 
c        in 'wfnfile'
c
c-----After record 3 the following input lines are allowed.
c     (records 4 and 5.i are mandatory and must be consecutive)
c
c=====Record 4: NGROUP ngroup 
c
c        The number domains in which the molecule is divided.
c
c        If ngroup is less than or equal to 0, or an integer is not given
c        after the NGROUP keyword, each basin is taken as an independent 
c        domain with a minimum (maximum) electronic population equal to 0 
c        (N_A) for ALPHA electrons and 0 (N_B) for BETA electrons, where 
c        N_A and N_B are the total number of ALPHA and BETA electrons in 
c        the molecule. In this case Record 5.i must be skipped.
c
c        The same applies if the 'NGROUP' keyword is not present in the 
c        input file.
c
c        If 'ngroup' is given a negative value the 'i' variable in the
c        following record runs for 1...NGROUP-1, and last group is 
c        intended to be formed by all those atoms not included in the
c        first NGROUP-1 groups.
c
c=====Record 5.i (i=1,NGROUP)
c
c         Record 5.i may have two different formats, (1) and (2). 
c
c         Format (1) is:
c
c    (1)  nfugrp(i), [ifugrp(j,i),j=1,nfugrp(i)], 
c              minelecA, maxelecA, minelecB, maxelecB
c
c         where
c
c         nfugrp(i)     = Number of atoms in group i.
c         ifugrp(j,i)   = Indices of atoms that belong to group i.
c         minelecA      = Minimum number of ALPHA electrons in group i.
c         maxelecA      = Maximum number of ALPHA electrons in group i.
c         minelecB      = Minimum number of BETA  electrons in group i.
c         maxelecB      = Maximum number of BETA  electrons in group i.
c
c         Format (2) is:
c
c    (2)  nfugrp(i),[ifugrp(j,i),j=1,nfugrp(i)]
c
c         In this case, EDF associates to group 'i' the values
c
c         minelecA = 0   maxelecA = NALPHA
c         minelecB = 0   maxelecB = NBETA
c
c         where NALPHA and NBETA are the total number of ALPHA and BETA
c         electrons of the molecule, as computed in the rdwfn.f routine.
c
c         In both cases, minelecA, maxelecA, minelecB, maxelecB MUST 
c         INCLUDE the CORE electrons, possibly defined in the COREMO
c         order below, i.e. minelecA, maxelecA, minelecB, maxelecB DO 
c         NOT refer exclusively to valence electrons (not equal to the 
c         total number of electrons when mocore # 0), but to total 
c         electrons. EDF assumes that each core MO accounts of one ALPHA 
c         electron and one BETA electron.
c
c=====Record 6: AOMNORM atom
c
c         When the keyword AOMNORM is read in, the program modifies
c         the elements of the atomic overlap matrix corresponding
c         to the center 'atom' such that SUM (i=1,ncent) aom(i,m,j) 
c         will be exactly 0.0 for m.ne.j or 1.0 for m.eq.j. If 'atom'
c         is not read in the program takes 'atom'=last atom of the 
c         input .WFN file.
c
c         After the normalizacion process is carried out, the new AOM 
c         elements are written in the file filedat//'.normalized'
c
c
c=====Record 7: EPSDET real-number 
c
c        The real-number has the following meaning: A product Ci * Cj
c        of a pair of determinants i and j in a CASSCF calculation is 
c        neglected when abs(Ci*Cj) < real-number. Default is 0.0.
c
c=====Record 8: EPSPROBA real-number 
c
c        The real-number has the following meaning: The computation 
c        of any probability for BETA electrons is avoided if the 
c        highest probability for ALPHA electrons is smaller than
c        this 'real-number'
c
c=====Record 9: PROBCUT real-number  
c
c        In the output of probabilities, only those probabilities 
c        greater than PROBCUT are written. Default is 0.0
c
c=====Record 10: TOLAOM real-number  
c
c        If the sum over all the centers of an atomic overlap matrix
c        element, SUM_n AOM(n,i,j), differs from delta_ij by more than
c        the 'real-number' the program stops since this means that
c        the AOM has not been appropriately computed. The default value
c        of real-number is 0.01.
c
c=====Record 11: NDETS ndets  
c 
c        In a CASSCF calculations only the first ndets determinants in 
c        the wavefunction are used (the wavefunction is renormalized).
c        If this record is not given EDF uses all the determinants of
c        the wave function.
c
c=====Record 12: EPSWFN epswfn
c
c        This is another order, related to the previous one, that can be
c        used to control the number of determinants of the input .WFN 
c        file that is actually used to expand the wavefunction. All the 
c        determinants whose (absolute value of the) coefficient in the 
c        wavefunction is lesser than 'epswfn' are neglected. After this, 
c        the wave function is renormalized. The default value is 0.0.
c
c=====Record 13: EPSWFNLOC epswfnloc
c
c        Equivalent to the above order but with the WFN expanded in
c        terms of (isopycnic) localized MOs. This order is relevant 
c        only if the FULLOC order is active (see below).
c
c=====Record 14: LARGE
c
c        Large output is requested. The default is short output.
c
c=====Record 15: RECUR
c
c        By default, when the number of groups is 2, the recurrence
c        relations of Cançes et al are not used. With this order, 
c        such recurrences are employed even in the case of MD WFN's.
c
c
c=====Record 16: FULLOC [ ALLCENTER ]
c
c        Localize the input natural orbitals. By default the isopycnic
c        localization is not carried out. If the 'allcenter' keyword is
c        not given the localization is carried out using the groups
c        defined in the input to contruct the localization function 
c        which is maximized. On the contrary, if 'allcenter' keyword is
c        is given the localization function is built using every center 
c        as an individual fragment.
c
c=====Record 17: NOPROB
c
c        If this keyword is given the exact EDF using the wavefunction 
c        defined in the input .WFN file is not computed. The defaut is 
c        to compute it.
c
c=====Record 18: PROBLOC
c
c        If this keyword is given, the EDF using the wavefunction
c        expressed in terms of the Localized MOs is computed. By default
c        this EDF is not computed. Clearly, this keyword is relevant only
c        in case that a previous localization of the input natural MOs 
c        has been performed. Since isopycnic localized MOs are normalized
c        but not orthogonal, the sum of all probabilities of the EDF in 
c        this case is not, in general, equal to 1.0.
c
c=====Record 19: NOPROBX
c
c        If this keyword is given, the approximate EDF using the wave-
c        function expressed in terms of the Localized MOs is not computed.
c        The defaut is to compute it. This keyword is relevant only
c        in case that a previous localization of the input natural MOs 
c        has been performed. The approximation in computing the EDF 
c        consists in assuming that all the localized MOs are orthogonal 
c        within the different fragments in which the molecule has been 
c        divided.
c
c=====Record 20: COREMO overlap-canonical
c
c        This keyword indicates that any molecular orbital of the input
c        wavefunction with a self-overlap in any of the fragments greater
c        than 'overlap-canonical' is considered as a fully-localized 
c        (i.e. core) orbital in that fragment. Consequently, it is 
c        excluded from the computation of the EDF. If the keyword 
c        COREMO is given but the 'overlap-canonical' value is not read,
c        the program assumes overlap-canonical = 0.99.
c
c=====Record 21: NOORDER
c        This keyword indicates that spinless probabilities are not 
c        ordered by decreasing value in the output file. By default, 
c        they are ordered provided that its number is smaller that the
c        NSTACK parameter, currently set to 4000.
c
c=====Record 22: DELETE n_1 n_2 n_3 ...
c        Let us assume that a multideterminantal wavefunction with NCORE
c        MOs has been read in. With this order, provided n_i <= NOCORE, 
c        the ith MO is elliminated from the wavefunction. After this
c        order, the actual number of molecular orbitals and CORE orbitals
c        (both ALPHA and BETA) are decreased by the number of valid n_i's 
c        which are read in this order.
c
c=====Record 23: SUPPRESS n_1 n_2 n_3 ...
c        Suppress from the AOM file the MOs n_1, n_2, n_3,..., writing
c        a new AOM file with the AOM integrals between the non-deleted
c        MOs, and the MOs n_1, n_2, n_3 from the WFN file, writing a 
c        new WFN file with the rest of MOs. The last task is only done
c        in case of single-Det wavefunctions. After performing these tasks 
c        the program stops.
c
c=====Record 23: LOCORE
c        Localize the CORE MOs from a multideterminantal wave function,
c        and replaces the canonical MOs of the wavefunction by these 
c        localized MOs. From this point on the original MOs are lost.
c
c=====Record 24: LOCSOME n1,n2, ...
c        Performs an isopycnic localization on the subset of canonical
c        MOs given by n1,n2, .... These can be typically CORE orbitals
c        in a multideterminantal wavefunction. After the localization
c        the AOM is appropriately modified.
c
c=====Record 25: NOMEM
c        For closed-shell systems and multiDet WFNs the ALPHA and BETA 
c        probabilities are saved in arrays instead of being stored in 
c        temporary files. This is the default (memedf=.true.) and in 
c        this case the routine 'mcalcedf.f' instead of 'calcedf.f' is 
c        used. This keyword is used to change this option (i.e. to 
c        set memedf=.false.)
c
c=====Record 26: PRSRS N_1 N_2 ... N_G
c        Compute the probability of the real space resonance structure
c        (PRSRS) in which N_1 electrons are in group 1, N_2 electrons in
c        group 2, ..., and N_G electrons in the last group. It is 
c        possible to put as many lines as this one in the input file.
c
c=====Record 27: MAXPOP maxgroup_1 maxgroup_2  ...
c
c        Define the maximum number of ALPHA or BETA electrons in each

c        localization is not carried out. If the 'allcenter' keyword is
c        not given the localization is carried out using the groups
c        defined in the input to contruct the localization function 
c        which is maximized. On the contrary, if 'allcenter' keyword is
c        is given the localization function is built using every center

c
c=====Record 39: DAFHSELECT n n_1 n_2 ... n_n
c
c        When this record is read in, the search of localized nc-2e MOs
c        IS NOT carried out for all the n-tuples with a level 'n' but
c        only for the n-tuple of atoms indicated by 'n_1 n_2 ... n_n'. 
c        There can be in the input file as many 'DAFHSELECT' orders as 
c        desired. If there are no DAFHSELECT orders with a given value 
c        of 'n', then ALL n-tuples of atoms with 'n' atoms are explored. 
c        On the other hand, if a given value of 'n' is skipped in the order 
c        'MXCENT' (see below), then all DAFHSELECT orders with this value
c        of 'n' are irrelevant. Let us consider an example. Assume a
c        molecule with 5 atoms, and consider that the following lines
c        are present in the input file:
c
c        DAFHSELECT 3 1 2 3
c        DAFHSELECT 3 1 3 5
c        DAFHSELECT 4 1 2 3 4
c
c        Then, the following nc-2e searches for localized MOs are performed:
c
c        All 1c-2e searches
c        All 2c-2e searches
c            3c-2e searches for the 3-tuples '1 2 3' and '1 3 5'
c            4c-2e searches for the 4-tuples '1 2 3 4' 
c        ALl 5c-2e
c        ALl 6c-2e
c           "
c           "
c        The above list goes up to a value of 'n' equal to 'mxcent' 
c        (see the MXCENT order below) and the values of 'n' equal to 
c        'n1', 'n2', ..., in this order are skipped.
c
c        At this moment, this restricted searchs works only in the case
c        of localized nc-2e MOs of Single-Det WFNs within the DAFHLOC
c        analysis.

c        The aim of this order is similar to that of the DAFHLOC. The 
c        difference is that DODAFH has a full control of the DAFH

c                            to discriminate whether a found MO is 
c                            localized or not.
c              'icen()' ---> The indices of the NCEN atoms.

c=====Record 40: CRITICS critics
c
c        When CANLOC or CHEMLOC is invoked, the routine determines the set
c        of localized MOs that are partially localized in each atom or 
c        group. A MO fulfils this condition is S_ii^A > critics. The

c
c     If the distance between two atoms A and B is smaller than

c     
c     This order is relevant only for the 'CHEMLOC' localization.
c     In every cycle of localization the value of each CRITOV(1..mxcent)
c     is multiplied by DAMPS (a number that should be smaller than 1.0) 
c     with the aim of reducing the localization requirement. 
c     The default value is 0.95
c

c======Record 43: MXCENT mxcent [ n1 n2 ... ]
c
c     In the progressive localization of MOs based on the diagonalization
c     of the DAFH in 1-, 2-, 3-,... centers, 'mxcent' defines the maximum
c     number of centers actually explored. The default value is 6. If the
c     cases with 'n1', 'n2', ... centers are to be skipped, they should
c     be indicated after the value of 'mxcent'. For instance, the order
c    
c     MXCENT 6 3 4 
c
c     analyzes the 1- 2- 5- and 6-center localizations.
c
c======Record 44: CRITOV [ { nn | critval } ]
c
c     If the overlap of an MO with itself in a n-center domain is greater 
c     than  critov(n), the routines 'chemloc', 'itaomloc', and 'itdafh' 
c     consider that this MO is already localized on that domain. 
c     The default values for all CRITOV(1..mxcent) is 0.95. If no 
c     parameters are given after the CRITOV keyword none of the current
c     values of CRITOV(1..mxcent) are changed. If an integer number 'nn'
c     such that (1.LE.NN.LE.MXCENT) is given after the CRITOV keyword
c     the new CRITOV(nn) is given the value 'critval' (in case a real
c     number is read in after reading the value of 'nn'). Finally,
c     if a real number 'critval' is read in after the CRITOV keyword,
c     all CRITOV(1..mxcent) values will have the value 'critval' from 
c     now on. When the 'DAFHLOC' order is invoked and the WFN file
c     corresponds to a correlated wavefunction the critiv() values
c     are not checked againts the diagonal AOM values but againts the
c     eigenvalues of the pertinent DAFH matrix.

c=====Record 45: MAXBOND maxbond
c
c     In the progessive DAFH density partitioning (when pairs of atoms
c     are being analized) 'maxbond' represents the maximum number of 
c     bonds necessary to travel from 'atom1' to 'atom2' which is actually
c     explored; i.e. if going from 'atom1' to 'atom2' requires more
c     tham 'maxbond' bonds the pair 'atom1-atom2' is not explored.
c     The default value of 'maxbond' is 1, i.e. only directly bonded
c     atoms are considered. The maximum value of 'maxbond' is

c     The default is 'skiph=.false.'.
c
c=====Record 48: EPSNEG [epsneg]
c
c     In the OPENLOC or OTHEROPEN localizations, diagonalizations
c     are involved of definite positives matrices that should have
c     all of their eigvenvalues positive. Numerical errors, however,
c     make that this not necessarily happens and some of the 
c     eigenvalues can be marginally negative. The value of 'epsneg'
c     is the largest value (in absolute value) allowed in order
c     that the method ends nicely. For instance, if epsneg=-1D-6
c     and all the eigenvalues are greater that this number the 
c     process continues up to the end. However, if an eigvenvalue
c     is smaller that -1D-6, for instance -1D-5, the program aborts.
c     The default value of epsneg is -1D-6. This value can be

c
c         The 'BONDING' keyword must be put after the 'NGROUP' order
c         defining the fragments of the molecule.
c
c         With the set of orders between the BONDING and ENDBONDING 
c         keywords, we try to represent the full EDF of the molecule 
c         (partitioned into a given set of fragments) as a direct product 
c         of [2c,2e] [and possibly (3c,2e)] chemical links. After
c         the 'BONDING' keyword the following orders can be given that
c         are exclusively relevant of the 'optedf.f' routine:

c
c       10) WEDF
c       11) WPOP
c       12) WDIS
c
c     The meaning of all of these orders is explained below.
c
c     1) 'ENDBONDING'
c
c     Sintax: ENDBONDING
c
c     Meaning: This order means that all the input that the routine 
c     'optedf' needs to work has been given, so that the calculation 
c     can start. This keyword in the input file is MANDATORY.
c
c     2) 'TYPE'
c
c     Sintax: TYPE type qq(type) ifixq(type) ffty(type) ifixf(type)
c
c     Meaning: This order defines a type of (2c,2e) bond. The maximum
c     value of 'type' is MAXBOND, a parameter whose current value is
c     maxbond=18. To increase the maximum possible number of types of
c     (2c,2e) bonds just increase the MVAR, MVARH, and MAXBOND values 
c     in the sentence 'parameter (mvar=36,mvarh=mvar/2,maxbond=18)' 
c     below and recompile.
c
c     'qq(type)' is 'the charge value of the bond', which is a measure
c     of the polarity of the bond. Its value is optimized in case that
c      the read in value of 'ifixq(type)' is non zero. Otherwise, the
c     value of 'qq(type)' is fixed. 
c
c     'ffty(type)' if the 'correlation factor of the bond'. Its value 
c     is optimized in case that the read in value of 'ifixf(type)' is
c     non zero. Otherwise, the value of 'ffty(type)' is fixed.
c
c     NO default values exist for 'qq(type)' and 'ffty(type)' and the
c     five values after the 'TYPE' keyword are mandatory. Tipical input
c     values for 'qq(type)' and 'ffty(type)' are 0.5 and 0.0,
c     respectively.
c
c     3) 'TYPE3C'
c
c     Sintax: TYPE3C type p200 p020 p002 p110 p101 f200 f020 f002 f110 f101
c
c     Meaning: This order defines a type of (3c,2e) bond. The maximum
c     value of 'type' is MAXBOND3C, a parameter whose current value is
c     maxbond3c=6. To increase the maximum possible number of types of
c     (3c,2e) bonds just increase the MAXBOND3C and MVAR3C values in the 
c     sentence 'parameter (mvar3c=30,maxbond3c=6)' below and recompile. 
c
c     'p200 p020 p002' are the input values for the probability that 
c     both electrons of the 3c bond are located in the first center (p200),
c     in the second center (p020), or in the third center (p002).
c
c     'p110' is the input value for the probability that one of
c     the electrons of the 3c bond is located in the first center and 
c     the second electron in the second center.
c
c     'p101' is the input value for the probability that one of
c     the electrons of the 3c bond is located in the first center and 
c     the second electron in the third center.
c
c     'f200 f020 f002 f110 f101' are five integer numbers that determine
c     if 'p200 p020 p002 p110 p101' are fixed or optimizable parameters.
c     For instance, f200=1 or 0 means that 'p200' is fixed or optimizable
c     respectively.
c
c     COMMENT: Fixing parameters does not work very well yet.
c
c      4) 'PAIR'
c
c      Sintax: PAIR fragment1 fragment2 type [ rtype ]
c
c      Meaning: This order indicates that a (2c,2e) bond of type 'type'
c      purportedly exists between the groups of atoms 'fragment1' and 
c      'fragment2'. 

c      'rtype' indicates the resonance structure used. The default is
c      rtype=1. It is recommended at this moment NOT TO ENTER THE
c      rtype VALUE IN THIS ORDER.
c
c     5) 'TRIO'
c
c     Sintax: TRIO fragment1 fragment2 fragment3 type [ rtype ]
c
c     Meaing: This order indicates that a (3c,2e) bond of type 'type'
c     purportedly exists between the groups of atoms 'fragment1',
c     'fragment2', and 'fragment3'.

c     'rtype' indicates the resonance structure used. The default is
c     rtype=1. It is recommended at this moment NOT TO ENTER THE
c     rtype VALUE IN THIS ORDER.
c
c     6) 'EPSBOND'
c
c     Sintax: EPSBOND epsbond
c
c     Convergence threshold in the EDF fitting. This order is not nece-
c     ssary, since a default value for 'epsbond' exists [10^(-4)].
c     
c
c     7) 'INICVAR'
c
c     Sintax: INICVAR h0
c
c     Meaning: 'h0' is a parameter used in the EDF fitting. Not necessary 
c     since a default value exists (0.1).
c
c     8) PRIN prin
c
c     Sintax: PRIN prin
c
c     Meaning: 'prin' is a printing level in the EDF fitting. Not necessary
c     since a default value exists (0).
c
c     9) PLUS/MINUS
c
c     Sintax { PLUS | MINUS } group  Resonance_structure
c
c     Meaning:
c
c
c
c
c
c     10) WEDF
c
c     Sintax: WEDF [ weigedf ]
c
c     Meaning: The N-electron EDF in terms of (2c,2e) [and possibly (3c,2e)]
c     links is optimized by minimizing:
c

c=====Record 62: ROHFLOC
c
c     Localizes separately the ALPHA and BETA spin-orbitals of a ROHF WFN 
c     and stops. A WFN file with the localized MOs is written. An AOM file
c     with the overlaps between the localized MOs is also written.
c
c=====Record 63: UHFLOC
c
c     The same as in the previous ROHFLOC order but with an UHF WFN.
c
c=====Record 64: DOENTROPY
c
c     Mutual Entropy Information (MEI) is obtained after the EDF is 
c     computed. By default the MEI is not obtained since it usually 
c     implies a very large output.
c
c=====Record 65: DIRPROB
c
c     This order computes by a pure brute force method the probabilities
c     of the sub-set of RSRSs with electron populations between minpopul(i) 
c     and maxpopul(i) values. At this time, it only works for SDWs. IT IS 
c     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO USE this order in molecules with many
c     electrons and/or divided into a large number of fragments.
c
c=====Record 66: FNO atom1 atom2 ...
c
c     Determines the Fragment Natural Orbitals of the fragment of the
